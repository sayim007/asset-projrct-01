## 🎨 Customization

### 1. Styling

Custom styles can be modified in the `assets/all.css` file.

* To change the primary color scheme, you can override Bootstrap's CSS variables within `all.css` or change the specific utility classes (`bg-primary`, `btn-primary`, etc.) directly in `index.html`.

### 2. Images

Replace the placeholder images (`https://via.placeholder.com/`) and the demo images (`assets/media/images/...`) with your actual product and banner images.

### 3. JavaScript Components

Bootstrap's JavaScript is linked via the CDN at the bottom of the `<body>` tag in `index.html`:

```html
<script src="[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js)"></script>
````

Ensure this link remains intact for the Navbar toggle, Carousel sliding, and Dropdowns to function correctly.
